    • What is a Server
A server is a term that refers to either a computer hardware device or a computer software program that provides some functionality or service for other programs or devices, known as "clients". The relationship between servers and clients is called the client–server model. Servers can offer different kinds of services, such as storing and sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing calculations for a client. A server can handle multiple clients at the same time, and a client can use multiple servers as well. A client can be a process that runs on the same machine as the server, or it can connect to the server over a network from a different machine. Some common examples of servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.
    • What is the role of the domain name
Domain names are essential for navigating the internet. They are the names that we use to identify different online resources, such as websites, email servers, or FTP servers. Instead of typing a long and complicated IP address, we can simply type a domain name that is easy to remember and understand.
For example, when you want to visit a website, you can type www.foobar.com instead of 196.189.23.234. This is much more convenient and user-friendly. The domain name system (DNS) is the service that matches domain names with IP addresses. When you enter a domain name in your browser, it sends a query to a DNS server, which then returns the corresponding IP address. Your browser then uses that IP address to connect to the server and display the content you requested.
Domain names are not only useful for humans, but also for machines. They allow multiple online resources to share the same IP address by using different domain names. This saves IP address space and makes it easier to manage online resources. Domain names also enable us to use subdomains and domain extensions to create more specific and descriptive names for different online resources.
    • What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
when you type www.foobar.com in your browser, DNS helps your browser find the IP address of the server that hosts the website.
One of the components of DNS is a DNS record, which is a piece of information that tells DNS how to handle a domain name. There are different kinds of DNS records for different purposes. For instance, a CNAME record is used to create an alias for a domain name. This means that you can use www.foobar.com as an alias for foobar.com, and they will point to the same IP address. This is useful if you want to have the same website for both the root domain and the subdomain.
    • What is the role of the web server
A web server is a software program that runs on a computer and stores content that can be accessed over the internet. The content can be anything from web pages and images to videos and applications.
When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the web server that hosts the website. The web server then processes the request and returns the content that you asked for. For example, if you type www.foobar.com in your browser, your browser will send a request to the web server at www.foobar.com, and the web server will send back the homepage of the website.
Web servers are very versatile and can handle different types of requests and content. They can use different protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SMTP, to communicate with clients and other servers. They can also run on different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, depending on the preferences of the web server administrator.
Web servers are an important part of the internet infrastructure and enable us to access a variety of online resources. They are also used for hosting websites and web applications that we use every day. Without web servers, we would not be able to browse the internet as we know it.
    • What is the role of the application server
An application server is a special kind of server that can host, install, and operate applications. It can handle different types of applications, from simple to complex, and from small to enterprise-level. An application server also provides a platform for the application logic, which is the core functionality of any application.
An application server has many advantages for application development and deployment. Some of these are:
- It reduces the size and complexity of client programs, which makes them easier to develop and maintain.
- It improves the performance of applications by caching and controlling the data flow between the server and the clients.
- It enhances the security of applications by implementing encryption, authentication, and authorization for data and user traffic.
    • What is the role of the database
Databases are essential tools for storing and managing data in a logical and organized way. They allow us to access, modify, and analyze data efficiently and securely. Databases are widely used in various domains, such as business, education, healthcare, and more.
The primary role of a database is to provide a mechanism for storing and retrieving data in an efficient and secure manner. Databases can store different kinds of data, such as customer data, financial records, inventory data, and more. They can also handle complex data relationships and queries.
Another important function of a database is to ensure data security and integrity. This means that databases have features that control who can access and modify the data, how to backup and restore the data in case of failure, and how to maintain data consistency and accuracy across different applications.

Databases are powerful tools that can help us store and manage data effectively and securely. They are used in many applications and scenarios that require data storage and manipulation.
    • What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
when a user requests a website from the server by typing its address in the web browser. The server then uses a set of rules called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) to establish a connection with the user’s computer. TCP/IP ensures that the data is sent and received reliably and efficiently. Then the server sends the website content to the user’s computer using another protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). HTTP is responsible for formatting and transferring the content, such as text, images, videos, etc. The user’s web browser then receives the content and renders it on the screen for the user to see. This is how a web server communicates with a user’s computer using TCP/IP and HTTP protocols.
    • What are SPOF issues with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure?
LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure is a popular web development solution that combines four different software technologies: Linux, Apache/ Nginx, MySQL, and PHP/perl/python . While LAMP/LEMP stack is a tried-and-tested web development solution, it has some issues that can lead to a single point of failure (SPOF) . Here are some of the common SPOF issues with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure:
    1. Hardware failures: If any hardware component of the system fails, it can cause the entire system to stop working. For example, if the hard drive fails, it can cause data loss and downtime.
    2. Software failures: If any software component of the system fails, it can cause the entire system to stop working. For example, if the web server or database server crashes, it can cause downtime.
    3. Network failures: If there is a network outage or connectivity issue between different components of the system, it can cause downtime.
    4. Security vulnerabilities: If there are any security vulnerabilities in any component of the system, it can lead to data breaches or other security incidents that can cause downtime or data loss
To avoid SPOF issues with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure, you can add redundancy in all potential SPOFs. Redundancy can be achieved at various levels such as hardware redundancy, software redundancy, network redundancy, and data redundancy. By adding redundancy in all potential SPOFs, you can ensure high availability and reliability of your web applications.
    • Downtime when maintenance needed Issue with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure?
Downtime when maintenance is needed is one of the issues with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure. This is because LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure uses a process-based model to handle incoming requests, which means that each incoming request is handled by a separate process. When you need to perform maintenance on the web server, you need to stop the web server process, which can cause downtime for your website.
To avoid downtime when performing maintenance on your LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure, you can use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This allows you to take one server offline for maintenance while the other servers continue to handle incoming traffic. You can also use a rolling deployment strategy to deploy new code without causing downtime. This involves deploying new code to one server at a time while the other servers continue to handle incoming traffic.
    • Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure?
One of the issues with LAMP/LEMP stack infrastructure is that it cannot scale if there is too much incoming traffic. This is because the Apache/ Nginx web server, which is a part of the LAMP/LEMP stack, uses a process-based model to handle incoming requests. This means that each incoming request is handled by a separate process, which can consume a significant amount of system resources. If there are too many incoming requests, the system can become overloaded and unresponsive.
To avoid this issue, you can use load balancing techniques to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This can be achieved by using a load balancer such as HAProxy or Nginx. Load balancing allows you to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, which can help you handle more traffic than a single server could handle. You can also use caching techniques to reduce the load on your servers by storing frequently accessed data in memory or on disk.
